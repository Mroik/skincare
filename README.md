## Introduction
This guide should give a general idea of importance of skincare and many considerations you should take into account. The main goal of skincare is to improve the appearance of your skin and skin health in general, but the journey to this goal is always tricky and usually requires a "trial and error" approach. 

**Should you do skincare?**
- Yes! As we age, our skin becomes less elastic; skin cell turnover slows down and minor or even major skin bruises and scars takes a longer time to heal; skin becomes more saggy; more wrinkles appear; skin issues might appear seemingly out of nowhere. Skincare is not just for women, all men should take care of their skin, because everyone wants to look younger for longer. It is better to start caring about your skin at a younger age since you will have a better chance to prevent many skin issues (including aging), but it is very important to understand how to take care of your skin properly to prevent unwanted side effects.

**Will this guide tell everything about skincare?**
- No. Skincare is an incredibly broad topic and there is a lot of information regarding skincare and a lot of research is still being done for new skincare techniques. This guide will give you a general idea of how to develop a skincare routine, but your own further research might be required.

**I don't need skincare!**
- OK, I will wait here, see you soon.
